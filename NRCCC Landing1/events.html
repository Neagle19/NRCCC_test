        <h2>Annual Washington Week Events</h2>
        <p>Since 1999 Christians and Jews have come together annually to represent their environmental positions before Congress, the White House and other government agencies. Initially the focus was on religious responsibility to conserve and protect our national forests. Now we include climate change, protection for endangered species, wilderness preservation, ending mountain-top removal, and protection of national parks from commercial development.<br><br>
        Each year the Washington Week program begins with a National Prayer Breakfast for Creation Care. A "Steward of Creation Award" is part of every prayer breakfast to honor those individuals who exemplify principled action in protecting and stewarding creation because of religious and spiritual values.<br><br>
        Catholics and Jews, Evangelicals, Eastern Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Mainline Protestants typically hold similar positions on most issues of creation care. To ensure religious integrity amidst different beliefs we have developed a protocol for interdenominational and interfaith work. It invites each participant to (1) reflect the fullness of his or her religious beliefs, but also to (2) respect the responsibility of every other participant to do the same. Where we come together is in our common conclusions regarding the right conduct and care that is required for good stewardship of God's creation.</p>
